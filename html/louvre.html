      <h2>Mona Lisa – The World’s Most Famous Painting</h2>
      
      <p>The Mona Lisa is a very famous painting made by the great Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci in the early 1500s. It shows a woman with a calm smile and a peaceful look, sitting in front of a soft landscape. The painting is well-known for her mysterious smile and the way her eyes seem to follow the viewer. The woman in the painting is believed to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a rich Italian merchant. Leonardo used soft colors and smooth brushstrokes to make the face look realistic. Today, the Mona Lisa is kept in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where millions of people visit it every year.</p>
