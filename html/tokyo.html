      <h2>Pipa (Traditional Chinese Lute)</h2>
      
      <p>The Pipa is a four-stringed plucked instrument that originated over 2,000 years ago in China. It has a pear-shaped body and is often adorned with inlaid designs like cranes or dragons, as seen here. The instrument reached high popularity during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE) and became a staple in court music, folk traditions, and storytelling performances.
